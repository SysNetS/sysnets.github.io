  year: 2025
  description: "Disaggregated computer architectures are emerging as an interesting paradigm according to which the components of a traditional monolithic server, such as CPU, memory, storage, and networking, are separated into distinct, often independently managed units that communicate over a network. Disaggregation can not only offer benefits such as greater flexibility, scalability, and resource optimization, but it can also enhance security. For example, in the context of enterprise routing, it can offer fine-grained control over the network in that allows one to deploy security policies, access control rules, and threat detection mechanisms more precisely, ensuring that only authorized traffic flows through the enterprise environment - thus enabling the zero-trust paradigm. It makes patch management easier, because its modularity allows different components to be patched independently. The same benefits translate also to cellular networks. Disaggregation is a key feature of the open radio access network (O-RAN) paradigm - whose goal is to make the radio access network intelligent, virtualized and fully interoperable. A disaggregation architecture has been proposed for post-quantum security for optical and packet transport equipment. However, disaggregation also introduces several unique security risks, such as increased attack surfaces, increased sensitive data exposure and data corruption, increased difficulty in tracing data provenance, insecure isolation among different components, insecure APIs. Also, well known security technologies, such as trusted execution environments, may have to be redesigned in the context of disaggregated architectures. In this talk, after an overview of those benefits and concerns, we focus on research approaches proposed to address some of these concerns in the context of O-RAN and in trusted execution environments."

- title: "Standing Firm in 5G: A Single-Round, Dropout-Resilient Secure Aggregation for Federated Learning"
  year: 2025
  description: "Federated learning (FL) has gained significant traction for privacy-preserving model training in next-generation networks, yet existing secure aggregation protocols often struggle with the massive connectivity and dynamic nature of 5G environments. We leverage the 5G architecture and propose simple yet efficient pre-computation techniques to design a highly efficient single-round secure aggregation protocol that meets the stringent performance requirement of mobile devices. This is achieved by leveraging the 5G architecture to employ base stations to assist the server in computing the model. Our protocol’s high resiliency is achieved through a novel adoption of key-homomorphic pseudorandom functions and t-out-of-k secret sharing mechanism. Experimental results show that our approach maintains strong security guarantees, achieves notable gains in computation and communication efficiency, and is well-suited for large-scale, on-device intelligence in 5G networks."

- title: "How Feasible is Augmenting Fake Nodes with Learnable Features as a counter-strategy against Link Stealing Attacks?"
  year: 2025
  description: "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used and deployed for graph-based prediction tasks. However, as good as GNNs are for learning graph data, they also come with the risk of privacy leakage. For instance, an attacker can run carefully crafted queries on the GNNs and, from the responses, can infer the existence of an edge between a pair of nodes. This attack, dubbed as a link-stealing attack, can jeopardize the user's privacy by leaking potentially sensitive information. To protect against this attack, we propose an approach called (N)ode (A)ugmentation for (R)estricting (G)raphs from (I)nsinuating their (S)tructure (NARGIS) and study its feasibility. NARGIS is focused on reshaping the graph embedding space so that the posterior from the GNN model will still provide utility for the prediction task but will introduce ambiguity for the link-stealing attackers. To this end, NARGIS applies spectral clustering on the given graph to facilitate it being augmented with new nodes -- that have learned features instead of fixed ones. It utilizes tri-level optimization for learning parameters for the GNN model, surrogate attacker model, and our defense model (i.e. learnable node features). We extensively evaluate NARGIS on three benchmark citation datasets over eight knowledge availability settings for the attackers. We also evaluate the model fidelity and defense performance on influence-based link inference attacks. Through our studies, we have figured out the best feature of NARGIS -- its superior fidelity-privacy performance trade-off in a significant number of cases. We also have discovered in which cases the model needs to be improved, and proposed ways to integrate different schemes to make the model more robust against link stealing attacks."

- title: "AKMA+: Privacy-Enhanced and Standard-Compatible AKMA for 5G Communications"
  year: 2025
  description: "The Authentication and Key Management for Applications (AKMA) protocol is a fundamental building block for security and privacy of 5G cellular networks. Therefore, it is critical that the protocol is free of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. Unfortunately, based on a detailed analysis of AKMA, we show that AKMA has several vulnerabilities that may lead to security and privacy breaches. We define AKMA+, an enhanced protocol for 5G communication that protects against security and privacy breaches while maintaining compatibility with existing standards. AKMA+ includes countermeasures for protecting communication between the user equipment (UE) and application functions (AFs) from attackers, including those within the home public land mobile network. These countermeasures ensure mutual authentication between the UE and the AKMA anchor function without altering the protocol flow. We also address vulnerabilities related to subscriber and AKMA key identifiers that could be exploited in linkability attacks. By obfuscating this data, AKMA+ prevents attackers from associating a target UE with its past application access. We employ formal verification to demonstrate that AKMA+ achieves key security and privacy objectives. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that AKMA+ incurs acceptable computational overhead, bandwidth costs, and UE battery consumption."

- title: "Gotta Detect ’Em All: Fake Base Station and Multi-Step Attack Detection in Cellular Networks"
  year: 2024
  image: FBSDetector.png
  description: "Fake base stations (FBSes) pose a significant security threat by impersonating legitimate base stations (BSes). Though efforts have been made to defeat this threat, up to this day, the presence of FBSes and the multi-step attacks (MSAs) stemming from them can lead to unauthorized surveillance, interception of sensitive information, and disruption of network services. Therefore, detecting these malicious entities is crucial to ensure the security and reliability of cellular networks. Traditional detection methods often rely on additional hardware, predefined rules, signal scanning, changes to protocol specifications, or cryptographic mechanisms that have limitations and incur huge infrastructure costs in accurately identifying FBSes. In this paper, we develop FBSDetector–an effective and efficient detection solution that can reliably detect FBSes and MSAs from layer-3 network traces using machine learning (ML) at the user equipment (UE) side. To develop FBSDetector, we create FBSAD and MSAD, the first-ever high-quality and large-scale datasets incorporating instances of FBSes and 21 MSAs. These datasets capture the network traces in different real-world cellular network scenarios (including mobility and different attacker capabilities) incorporating legitimate BSes and FBSes. Our novel ML framework, specifically designed to detect FBSes in a multi-level approach for packet classification using stateful LSTM with attention and trace level classification and MSAs using graph learning, can effectively detect FBSes with an accuracy of 96% and a false positive rate of 2.96%, and recognize MSAs with an accuracy of 86% and a false positive rate of 3.28%. We deploy FBSDetector as a real-world solution to protect end-users through a mobile app and validate it in real-world environments. Compared to the existing heuristic-based solutions that fail to detect FBSes, FBSDetector can detect FBSes in the wild in real time."

- title: "CellularLint: A Systematic Approach to Identify Inconsistent Behavior in Cellular Network Specifications"
  year: 2024
  image: CellularLint.png
  description: "In recent years, there has been a growing focus on scrutinizing the security of cellular networks, often attributing security vulnerabilities to issues in the underlying protocol design descriptions. These protocol design specifications, typically extensive documents that are thousands of pages long, can harbor inaccuracies, underspecifications, implicit assumptions, and internal inconsistencies. In light of the evolving landscape, we introduce CellularLint–a semi-automatic framework for inconsistency detection within the standards of 4G and 5G, capitalizing on a suite of natural language processing techniques. Our proposed method uses a revamped few-shot learning mechanism on domain-adapted large language models. Pre-trained on a vast corpus of cellular network protocols, this method enables CellularLint to simultaneously detect inconsistencies at various levels of semantics and practical use cases. In doing so, CellularLint significantly advances the automated analysis of protocol specifications in a scalable fashion. In our investigation, we focused on the Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) and the security specifications of 4G and 5G networks, ultimately uncovering 157 inconsistencies with 82.67% accuracy. After verification of these inconsistencies on 3 open-source implementations and 17 commercial devices, we confirm that they indeed have a substantial impact on design decisions, potentially leading to concerns related to privacy, integrity, availability, and interoperability."

- title: "Security Attacks to the Name Management Protocol in Vehicular Networks"
  year: 2024
  description: "Trucks play a critical role in today’s transportation system, where minor disruptions can result in a major social impact. Intra Medium and Heavy Duty (MHD) communications broadly adopt SAE-J1939 recommended practices that utilize Name Management Protocol (NMP) to associate and manage source addresses with primary functions of controller applications. This paper exposes 19 vulnerabilities in the NMP, uses them to invent various logical attacks, in some cases leveraging and in all cases validating with formal methods, and discusses their impacts. These attacks can–➀ stealthily deny vehicle start-up by pre-playing recorded claims in monotonically descending order; ➁ successfully restrain critical vehicular device participation and institute a dead beef attack, causing reflash failure by performing a replay attack; ➂ cause stealthy address exhaustion, Thakaavath–exhaustion in Sanskrit, which rejects an address-capable controller application from network engagement by exhausting the usable address space via pre-playing claims in monotonically descending order; ➃ poison the controller application’s internally maintained source address-function association table after bypassing the imposter detection protection and execute a stealthy SA-NAME Table Poisoning Attack thereby disable radar and Anti Brake System (ABS), as well as obtain retarder braking torque dashboard warnings; ➄ cause Denial of Service (DoS) on claim messages by predicting the delay in an address reclaim and prohibiting the associated device from participating in the SAE-J1939 network; ➅ impersonate a working set master to alter the source addresses of controller applications to execute a Bot-Net attack; ➆ execute birthday attack, a brute-force collision attack to command an invalid or existing name, thereby causing undesired vehicle behavior. The impact of these attacks is validated by demonstrations on real trucks in operation in a practical setting and on bench setups with a real engine controller connected to a CAN bus."

- title: "Segment-Based Formal Verification of WiFi Fragmentation and Power Save Mode"
  year: 2024
  description: "The IEEE 802.11 family of standards, better known as WiFi, is a widely used protocol utilized by billions of users. Previous works on WiFi formal verification have mostly focused on the four-way handshake and other security aspects. However, recent works have uncovered severe vulnerabilities in functional aspects of WiFi, which can cause information leakage for billions of devices. No formal analysis method exists able to reason on the functional aspects of the WiFi protocol. In this paper, we take the first steps in addressing this gap and present an extensive formal analysis of the functional aspects of the WiFi protocol, more specifically, the fragmentation and the power-save-mode process. To achieve this, we design a novel segment-based formal verification process and introduce a practical threat model (i.e., MAC spoofing) in Tamarin to reason about the various capabilities of the attacker. To this end, we verify 68 properties extracted from WiFi protocol specification, find 3 vulnerabilities from the verification, verify 3 known attacks, and discover 2 new issues. These vulnerabilities and issues affect 14 commercial devices out of 17 tested cases, showing the prevalence and impact of the issues. Apart from this, we show that the proposed countermeasures indeed are sufficient to address the issues. We hope our results and analysis will help vendors adopt the countermeasures and motivate further research into the verification of the functional aspects of the WiFi protocol."

- title: "SPEC5G: A Dataset for 5G Cellular Network Protocol Analysis"
  year: 2023
  description: "5G is the 5th generation cellular network protocol. It is the state-of-the-art global wireless standard that enables an advanced kind of network designed to connect virtually everyone and everything with increased speed and reduced latency. Therefore, its development, analysis, and security are critical. However, all approaches to the 5G protocol development and security analysis, e.g., property extraction, protocol summarization, and semantic analysis of the protocol specifications and implementations are completely manual. To reduce such manual effort, in this paper, we curate SPEC5G the first-ever public 5G dataset for NLP research. The dataset contains 3,547,586 sentences with 134M words, from 13094 cellular network specifications and 13 online websites. By leveraging large-scale pre-trained language models that have achieved state-of-the-art results on NLP tasks, we use this dataset for security-related text classification and summarization. Security-related text classification can be used to extract relevant security-related properties for protocol testing. On the other hand, summarization can help developers and practitioners understand the high level of the protocol, which is itself a daunting task. Our results show the value of our 5G-centric dataset in 5G protocol analysis automation. We believe that SPEC5G will enable a new research direction into automatic analyses for the 5G cellular network protocol and numerous related downstream tasks. Our data and code are publicly available."

  year: 2023
  image: BLEDiff.png
  description: "In this work, we develop an automated, scalable, property-agnostic, and black-box protocol noncompliance checking framework called BLEDiff that can analyze and uncover noncompliant behavior in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol implementations. To overcome the enormous manual effort of extracting BLE protocol reference behavioral abstraction and security properties from a large and complex BLE specification, BLEDiff takes advantage of having access to multiple BLE devices and leverages the concept of differential testing to automatically identify deviant noncompliant behavior. In this regard, BLEDiff first automatically extracts the protocol FSM of a BLE implementation using the active automata learning approach. To improve the scalability of active automata learning for the large and complex BLE protocol, BLEDiff explores the idea of using a divide and conquer approach. BLEDiff essentially divides the BLE protocol into multiple sub-protocols, identifies their dependencies and extracts the FSM of each sub-protocol separately, and finally composes them to create the large protocol FSM. These FSMs are then pair-wise tested to automatically identify diverse deviations. We evaluate BLEDiff with 25 different commercial devices and demonstrate it can uncover 13 different deviant behaviors with 10 exploitable attacks. "

  description: "In this paper, we evaluate the security of the Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) protocol by proposing the VWAnalyzer framework. We model five critical procedures of the VoWiFi protocol and deploy a model-based testing approach to uncover potential design flaws. Since the standards of the VoWiFi protocol contain underspecifications that can lead to vulnerable scenarios, VWAnalyzer explicitly deals with them. Unlike prior approaches that do not consider the underspecifications, VWAnalyzer adopts a systematic approach that constructs diverse and viable scenarios based on the underspecifications and substantially reduces the number of possible scenarios. Then the scenarios are verified against security properties. VWAnalyzer automatically generates 960 viable scenarios to be analyzed among 10,368 scenarios (91% decrease) from the initial models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VWAnalyzer by verifying 38 properties and uncovering 3 new attacks. Notable among our findings is the denial-of-cellular-connectivity attack, due to insecure handover that disconnects the user through both VoWiFi and VoLTE. To ensure that the exposed attacks pose real threats and are indeed realizable in practice, we have validated the attacks in a real-world testbed. We also report several implementations issues that were uncovered during the testbed evaluation."

- title: "Noncompliance as Deviant Behavior: An Automated Black-box Noncompliance Checker for 4G LTE Cellular Devices"
  year: 2021
  image: DIKEUE.png
  description: "The work focuses on developing an automated black-box testing approach called DIKEUE that checks 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) control-plane protocol implementations in commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) cellular devices (also, User Equipments or UEs) for noncompliance with the standard. Unlike prior noncompliance checking approaches which rely on property-guided testing, DIKEUE adopts a property-agnostic, differential testing approach, which leverages the existence of many different control-plane protocol implementations in COTS UEs. DIKEUE uses deviant behavior observed during differential analysis of pairwise COTS UEs as a proxy for identifying noncompliance instances. For deviant behavior identification, DIKEUE first uses black-box automata learning, specialized for 4G LTE control-plane protocols, to extract input-output finite state machine (FSM) for a given UE. It then reduces the identification of deviant behavior in two extracted FSMs as a model checking problem. We applied DIKEUE in checking noncompliance in 14 COTS UEs from 5 vendors and identified 15 new deviant behavior as well as 2 previous implementation issues. Among them, 11 are exploitable whereas 3 can cause potential interoperability issues. "

  year: 2020
  description: "Application processors of modern smartphones use the AT interface for issuing high-level commands (or AT-commands) to the baseband processor for performing cellular network operations (e.g., placing a phone call). Vulnerabilities in this interface can be leveraged by malicious USB or Bluetooth peripherals to launch pernicious attacks. In this article, we propose ATFuzzer, which uses a grammar-guided evolutionary fuzzing approach that mutates production rules of the AT-command grammar instead of concrete AT commands to evaluate the correctness and robustness of the AT-command execution process. To automate each step of the analysis pipeline, ATFuzzer first takes as input the 3GPP and other vendor-specific standard documents and, following several heuristics, automatically extracts the seed AT command grammars for the fuzzer. ATFuzzer uses the seed to generate both valid and invalid grammars, following our cross-over and mutation strategies to evaluate both the integrity and execution of AT-commands. Empirical evaluation of ATFuzzer on 10 Android smartphones from 6 vendors revealed 4 invalid AT command grammars over Bluetooth and 14 over USB with implications ranging from DoS, downgrade of cellular protocol version, to severe privacy leaks. The vulnerabilities along with the invalid AT-command grammars were responsibly disclosed to affected vendors and assigned CVEs."

  year: 2019
  description: "The paper proposes 5GReasoner, a framework for property-guided formal verification of control-plane protocols spanning across multiple layers of the 5G protocol stack. The underlying analysis carried out by 5GReasoner can be viewed as an instance of the model checking problem with respect to an adversarial environment. Due to an effective use of behavior-specific abstraction in our manually extracted 5G protocol, 5GReasoner's analysis generalizes prior analyses of cellular protocols by reasoning about properties not only regarding packet payload but also multi-layer protocol interactions. We instantiated 5GReasoner with two model checkers and a cryptographic protocol verifier, lazily combining them through the use of abstraction-refinement principle. Our analysis of the extracted 5G protocol model covering 6 key control-layer protocols spanning across two layers of the 5G protocol stack with 5GReasoner has identified 11 design weaknesses resulting in attacks having both security and privacy implications. Our analysis also discovered 5 previous design weaknesses that 5G inherits from 4G, and can be exploited to violate its security and privacy guarantees."

- title: "Maximizing Heterogeneous Coverage in Over and Under Provisioned Visual Sensor Networks "
  year: 2018
  description: "We address “heterogeneous coverage” in visual sensor networks where coverage requirements of some randomly deployed targets vary from target to target. The main objective is to maximize the coverage of all the targets to achieve their respective coverage requirement by activating minimal sensors. The problem can be viewed as an interesting variation of the classical Max-Min problem (i.e., Maximum Coverage with Minimum Sensors (MCMS)). Therefore, we study the existing Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for single and k-coverage MCMS problem in the state-of-the-art and modify them to solve the heterogeneous coverage problem. We also propose a novel Integer Quadratic Programming (IQP) formulation that minimizes the Euclidean distance between the achieved and the required coverage vectors. Both ILP and IQP give exact solution when the problem is solvable but as they are non-scalable due to their computational complexity, we devise a Sensor Oriented Greedy Algorithm (SOGA) that approximates the formulations. For under-provisioned networks where there exist insufficient number of sensors to meet the coverage requirements, we propose prioritized IQP and reduced-variance IQP formulations to capture prioritized and group wise balanced coverage respectively. Moreover, we develop greedy heuristics to tackle under provisioned networks. Extensive evaluations based on simulation illustrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed formulations and heuristics under various network settings. Additionally, we compare our methodologies and algorithm with two state-of-the-art algorithms available for target coverage and show that our methodologies and algorithm substantially outperform both the algorithms."
