  year: 2022
  description: "In this paper, we consider the problem of enabling latency-sensitive and safety-critical edge applications on 5G networks. We identify fundamental control plane design challenges and posit enabling these applications requires re-thinking the cellular control plane. We propose a new edge-based cellular control plane, CellClone, which provides fast and fault-tolerant control plane processing."

- title: "LTE NFV Rollback Recovery"
  year: 2022
  description: "Achieving high service availability is challenging because failover procedure must keep the latencysensitive control-plane procedures intact during failures. Through our empirical study, we show that existing recovery mechanisms on the cloud and standardized LTE solutions are coarse-grained, thus unable to quickly recover from failures. They incur LTE service outage, lost network connectivity, and slow recovery. To address these issues, we describe a new design for faulttolerant LTE EPC. It provides quick failure detection and timely recovery from failed operations. To reduce failure detection time, it leverages frequent retransmission of LTE control-plane signaling within EPC as an indication of failure. To recover from failure, it adopts a checkpointing based rollback recovery approach in the LTE context and addresses the shortcomings known in the classic checkpointing approach."

- title: "On Key Reinstallation Attacks over 4G LTE Control-Plane: Feasibility and Negative Impact"
  year: 2021
  description: "In this paper, we show that several design choices in the current LTE security setup are vulnerable to key reinstallation attacks. Specifically, on the control plane, the LTE security association setup procedures, which establish security between the device and the network, are disconnected. The keys are installed through one procedure, whereas their associated parameters (such as uplink and downlink counters) are reset through another different procedure."

- title: "Highly Available Service Access Through Proactive Events Execution in LTE NFV"
  year: 2021
  description: "This paper proposes Fat-proxy which acts as a stand-alone execution engine of critical network events. Through space uncoupling, we execute several signalling messages in parallel while skipping unnecessary messages to reduce event execution time and signalling overhead while ensuring highly available service access. We build our system prototype of open source LTE core network over virtualized platform. Our results show that we can reduce event execution time and signalling overhead upto 50% and 40%, respectively."
